# Changelog

Notable changes to this service, newest first. Dated rather than versioned: the image is
published per branch and commit, so what matters is what landed on a given day. This file is
written for whoever runs the service or integrates against it.

## 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **`service.version` in the logs now reports the build that is running.** Every log line
  carries that field, and until now it was the compiled-in development default. The pipeline
  had always computed a `<branch>-<short-sha>` version and passed it to the image build, but
  the Dockerfile never handed it to the linker, so the value was computed and then discarded —
  which meant no log line could tell you which build produced it. Both halves are wired now.
  Expect a real version where the development default used to appear.
- Nothing else about the image changed: same entrypoint, same ports, same healthcheck, same
  configuration, same behaviour.

### Notes

- Line endings for Go, module, script and Docker files are pinned to LF. Nothing in the
  repository changes — those files were already stored that way — but a Windows working copy
  now holds the same bytes the pipeline builds from, so a local formatting or lint run stops
  reporting differences that do not exist in CI.
